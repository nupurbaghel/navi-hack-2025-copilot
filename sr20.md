Foreword

FRONTMATTER
FOREWORD

This Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) has been prepared by Cirrus to famil-
iarize operators with the aircraft. Read this AFM carefully. It provides oper-
ational procedures that will ensure the operator obtains the performance
published in the manual, data designed to allow the most efficient and safe
use of the airplane, and basic information to assist in maintaining the
airplane in airworthy condition.

• NOTE •
All limitations, procedures, maintenance & servicing require-
ments, and performance data contained in this AFM are manda-
tory for compliance with FAA operating rules and for continued
airworthiness of the airplane.
This AFM includes the material required to be furnished to the pilot by the
Code of Federal Regulations (CFRs) and additional information provided
by Cirrus and constitutes the FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual for
the aircraft.

The Airplane Flight Manual

This AFM has been prepared using GAMA Specification #1 for Airplane
Flight Manual, Revision 2, dated 18 October 1996 as the content model and
format guide. However, some deviations from this specification were made
for clarity. The AFM is presented in loose-leaf form for ease in inserting
revisions and is sized for convenient storage. Tabbed dividers throughout
the AFM allow quick reference to each section. Logical and convenient
Tables of Contents are located at the beginning of each section to aid in
locating specific data within that section. The AFM is divided into ten
sections as follows:
Section 1 ........................................................................................ General
Section 2 ..................................................................................Limitations
Section 3 ..............................................................Emergency Procedures
Section 3A ............................................................ Abnormal Procedures
Section 4 ....................................................................Normal Procedures
Section 5 ...................................................................... Performance Data
Section 6 ...................................................................Weight and Balance
Section 7 .................................................................. Systems Description
Section 8 .............................................................Handling and Servicing
Section 9 ................................................................... Log of Supplements
Section 10 ................................................................... Safety Information

FOREWORD

CIRRUS
SR20

The data presented in this AFM is the result of extensive flight tests and is
approved by the Federal Aviation Administration. However, as new proce-
dures or performance data are developed, the AFM will be revised.

• NOTE •
It is the responsibility of the owner to ensure that the Airplane
Flight Manual is current at all times. Therefore, it is very
important that all revisions be properly incorporated into this
AFM as soon as they become available.

Revising the Airplane Flight Manual

Two types of revisions may be issued for this manual: Temporary and
Numbered.
Temporary revisions are printed on yellow paper, normally cover only one
topic or procedure, and are issued to provide safety related information in
a timely manner. All the information needed to properly file a temporary
revision is included on the revision itself. Typically, a temporary revision is
superseded and replaced by the next numbered revision.
Numbered revisions are printed on white paper, normally cover several
subjects, and are issued as general updates to the AFM. Each numbered
revision includes an “Instruction Sheet”, a “List of Effective Pages”, and a
“Revision Highlights” page. The “Instruction Sheet” is intended to assist
the manual holder in removing superseded pages and inserting new or
superseding pages. The “List of Effective Pages” shows the issue or revision
status of all pages in the AFM. The “Revision Highlights” page gives a brief
description of changes made to each page in the current revision.

Identifying Revised Material

Each page in the AFM has the issue date at the lower inside corner opposite
the page number and the revision level under the part number. Issue dates
will correspond to the issue dates of the Original Issue, any revisions, or
reissues on the List of Effective Pages. The Original Issue and its issue date
will be listed on the List of Effective Pages. In the event that the majority of
pages in the AFM are revised, Cirrus may determine that it is more effective
to reissue the AFM. Reissues will be identified by the word “Reissue”
followed by a letter indicating the reissue level; for example, “Reissue A” on
the List of Effective Pages along with its issue date. Revisions will be identi-
fied by the word “Revision” followed by the revision number on the List of
Effective Pages; for example, “Revision 2” (Original Issue, Revision 2) or
“Revision B1” (Reissue B, Revision 1).
Revised material on a page can be identified by a change bar located at the
outside page margin.

SUPPLEMENTS

Revisions to the Airplane Flight Manual

AFM revisions, temporary revisions, and supplements can be downloaded
from Cirrus at www.cirrusaircraft.com, or from the Authorized Service
Center website.
Paper copies of AFM revisions and supplements can be purchased from
Cirrus Connection at www.cirrusconnection.com.

Supplements

The Supplements section (Section 9) of this AFM contains FAA Approved
Supplements necessary to safely and efficiently operate the airplane when
equipped with optional equipment not provided with the standard airplane
or not included in the AFM. Supplements are essentially “mini-manuals”
and may contain data corresponding to most sections of the AFM. Data in
a supplement either adds to, supersedes, or replaces similar data in the basic
AFM.
Section 9 includes a “Log of Supplements” page preceding all Cirrus
Supplements produced for this airplane. The “Log of Supplements” page
can be utilized as a “Table of Contents” for Section 9. If the airplane is
modified at a non-Cirrus facility through an STC or other approval
method, it is the owner’s responsibility to ensure that the proper supple-
ment, if applicable, is installed in the AFM and that the supplement is prop-
erly recorded on the “Log of Supplements” page.
FAA Approved AFM Supplements must be in the airplane for flight oper-
ations when the subject optional equipment is installed or the special oper-
ations are to be performed.

Retention of Data

In the event a new title page is issued, the weight and balance data changes,
the equipment list changes, or the “Log of Supplements” is replaced, the
owner must ensure that all information applicable to the airplane is trans-
ferred to the new pages and the aircraft records are current. It is not a
requirement that owners retain information, such as supplements, that is
not applicable to their airplane.
In the event a new AFM is purchased, the owner must ensure that all infor-
mation applicable to the airplane is transferred to the new AFM and the
aircraft records are current.

Warnings, Cautions, and Notes

Warnings, Cautions, and Notes are used throughout this AFM to focus
attention on special conditions or procedures as follows:

• WARNING •
Warnings are used to call attention to operating procedures which, if
not strictly observed, may result in personal injury or loss of life.

• CAUTION •
Cautions are used to call attention to operating procedures which,
if not strictly observed, may result in damage to equipment.
• NOTE •
Notes are used to highlight specific operating conditions or steps
of a procedure.

Airplane Serial Number Effectivity

For aircraft serial numbers with an alphabetical suffix, the letter designa-
tion should be ignored when reading effectivity notes in service and oper-
ating documents.
For example, "2491H" is the same as "2491" when referencing effectivity to
determine applicable operation for this aircraft.

Standard
Temperature

Outside Air Temperature is the free air static
temperature obtained from in-flight temperature
indications or from ground meteorological sources. It is
expressed in either °C or °F.

Pressure Altitude is the altitude read from the altimeter
when the altimeter’s barometric adjustment has been
set to 29.92 in.Hg (1013.21 mb) corrected for position
and instrument error. In this Handbook, altimeter
instrument errors are assumed to be zero.

Standard Temperature is the temperature that would be
found at a given pressure altitude in the standard
atmosphere. It is 59 °F (15 °C) at sea level pressure
altitude and decreases approximately 4 °F (2 °C) for
each 1000 feet of altitude increase. See ISA definition.

which all horizontal distances are measured for
balance purposes.

Fuselage Station (FS) is a location along the airplane
fuselage measured in inches from the reference datum
and expressed as a number. For example: A point 123
inches aft of the reference datum is FS 123.

Center of Gravity is the point at which an airplane
would balance if suspended. Its distance from the
reference datum is found by dividing the total
moment by the total weight of the airplane.

Arm is the horizontal distance from the reference
datum to the center of gravity (CG) of an item. The
airplane’s arm is obtained by adding the airplane’s
individual moments and dividing the sum by the total
weight.

Moment is the product of the weight of an item
multiplied by its arm.

Basic Empty Weight is the actual weight of the
airplane including all operating equipment that has a
fixed location in the airplane. The basic empty weight
includes the weight of unusable fuel and full oil.

Mean Aerodynamic Chord is the chord drawn
through the centroid of the wing plan area.

Leading Edge of Mean Aerodynamic Chord is the
forward edge of MAC given in inches aft of the
reference datum (fuselage station).

Maximum Gross
Weight

Maximum Gross Weight is the maximum permissible
weight of the airplane and its contents as listed in the
aircraft specifications.

Maximum Takeoff

Instruction No. 1014.

• NOTE •
The correct grade of oil to be used is based on environmental
conditions. If the aircraft is going to be flown into an area that is
much warmer or colder than the aircraft is usually operated in, use
a different viscosity of oil.
During operation, if the oil inlet temperatures are near the
maximum permitted temperatures, then a higher viscosity oil can
help to decrease the temperatures.

RAIM availability.

b) Accomplishment of ILS, LOC, LOC-BC, LDA, SDF, MLS or any

other type of approach not approved for GPS overlay with the GPS
receiver is not authorized.

c) Use of the VOR/ILS receiver to fly approaches not approved for GPS
requires VOR/ILS navigation data to be present on the display.

d) Vertical Navigation information for approach procedures that do

not meet the ICAO Annex 10 requirements for precision approaches
may be utilized for advisory information only. Use of Vertical Navi-
gation information for Instrument Approach Procedures does not
guarantee step-down fix altitude protection, or arrival at approach
minimums in normal position to land.

e) IFR non-precision approach approval is limited to published

approaches within the U.S. National Airspace System. Approaches to
airports in other airspace are not approved unless authorized by the
appropriate governing authority.

f) RNAV approaches must be conducted utilizing the GPS sensor.

tional awareness tool only and may not provide the accuracy fidelity on
which to solely base terrain or obstacle avoidance maneuvering decisions.
To avoid getting unwanted alerts, TAWS must be inhibited when landing
at an airport that is not included in the airport database.

• NOTE •
Only vertical maneuvers are recommended responses to warnings
and cautions unless operating in VMC or the pilot determines,
using all available information and instruments, that a turn, in
addition to the vertical escape maneuver, is the safest course of
action. During certain operations, warning thresholds may be
exceeded due to specific terrain or operating procedures. During
day VFR flight, these warnings may be considered as cautionary.

Max Viz Enhanced Vision System (Optional)

Introduction

SECTION 3: EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
INTRODUCTION

This section provides procedures for handling emergencies and critical
flight situations that may occur while operating the aircraft. Although
emergencies caused by airplane, systems, or engine malfunctions are rare,
the guidelines described in this section should be considered and applied as
necessary should an emergency arise.
Emergency procedures associated with optional equipment are not
described in this section.
Although this section provides procedures for handling most emergencies
and critical flight situations that could arise in the aircraft, it is not a substi-
tute for proper flight training, thorough knowledge of the airplane, and
recognized piloting techniques and standards. A thorough study of the
information in this handbook while on the ground will help you prepare for
time-critical situations in the air.

• NOTE •
Refer to Section 9: Log of Supplements for optional equipment
Emergency Procedures.
Crew Alert System (CAS) Messaging
Warnings

Displayed in red against a black background, Warning CAS messages arise
during emergency situations that require immediate flight crew awareness
and immediate flight crew response.
•

A flashing Warning CAS message with an accompanying aural alert
requires immediate action.
A Warning CAS message with no accompanying aural alert requires
attention, dependent on workload. It may also require performing
maintenance or taking corrective action prior to next flight. Warnings
with no aural alert typically occur while on ground.

•

CAPS Guidance

All Cirrus aircraft are equipped with a pilot or passenger activated ballistic
airframe parachute system. The system is capable of lowering the aircraft
and occupants safely to the ground for life threatening emergencies. CAPS
provides pilots and passengers an alternative means of handling various life
threatening emergency situations. In many cases CAPS may offer a safer
option for occupants as compared to continued flight or traditional
countermeasures. Pilots flying Cirrus aircraft must be properly trained and
familiar with CAPS guidance, limitations, and operating procedures. Refer
to Section 10, Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS), for CAPS
deployment and guidance information.

INTRODUCTION

Preflight Planning

CIRRUS
SR20

Enroute emergencies caused by weather can be minimized or eliminated by
careful flight planning and good judgment when unexpected weather is
encountered.

Preflight Inspections/Maintenance

In-flight mechanical problems in the aircraft will be extremely rare if
proper preflight inspections and maintenance are practiced. Always
perform a thorough walk-around inspection before any flight to ensure
that no damage occurred during the previous flight or while the airplane
was on the ground. Pay special attention to any oil leaks or fuel stains that
could indicate engine problems.

• NOTE •
Refer to Section 4: Normal Procedures, "Preflight Inspection" for
more information.

Methodology

Aircraft emergencies are dynamic events. Because of this, it is impossible to
enumerate every action a pilot should properly undertake in response to a
particular situation. However, four basic actions can be applied to any
emergency. They are:

Maintain Aircraft Control

Many minor aircraft emergencies turn into major ones when the pilot fails
to maintain aircraft control. Do not panic and do not fixate on a particular
problem. Over-attention to a warning light during an instrument approach
can lead to a pilot-induced unusual attitude, and possibly worse. To avoid
this, even in an emergency: always aviate, navigate, and communicate, in
that order. Never let anything interfere with your control of the airplane.
Never stop flying.

Analyze the Situation

Once you are able to maintain control of the aircraft, assess the situation.
Read all warning and caution messages. Evaluate the engine parameters.
Consider all aircraft operational information at your disposal.

Take Appropriate Action

In many situations, the procedures listed in this section will either correct
or mitigate the aircraft problem or allow safe recovery of the aircraft.
Follow them and use good pilot judgment.

SECTION 3: EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
INTRODUCTION

The Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS) should be activated in the
event of a life-threatening emergency where CAPS deployment is deter-
mined to be safer than continued flight and landing.

• NOTE •
Refer to Section 10, Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS) for
CAPS deployment information and landing considerations.

Land as Soon as Conditions Permit

Once you have evaluated and responded to the emergency, assess your next
move. Perform any non-critical “clean-up” items in the checklist and land
as soon as practicable. Even if the airplane appears to be in sound condi-
tion, it may not be.

• NOTE •
Refer to Landing Guidance in this section for factors that deter-
mine landing criticality.

Circuit Breakers

Some procedures involve manipulating circuit breakers (CBs). The
following criteria should be followed during “Circuit Breaker” steps:
•

Intentional pulling of circuit breakers during flight, other than as
required in specific procedures, may cause abnormal or unexpected
system behavior and is not recommended.

• When instructed to “SET”, the appropriate circuit breaker should be

checked for normal condition. If the circuit breaker is not “SET”, it
may be reset only once. If the circuit breaker opens again, do not reset.

• When instructed to “PULL”, the appropriate circuit breaker should

only be pulled and not reset.

• When instructed to “CYCLE”, the appropriate circuit breaker should
be pulled, delayed for several seconds, and reset only once. Allow suffi-
cient cooling time for circuit breakers that are reset through a
“CYCLE” procedure.

Memory Items

Checklist steps emphasized by a rectangular enclosure, such as the example
below, should be memorized for accomplishment without reference to the
procedure, due to the nature of their urgency.

with a symbol to designate sub-sections within the procedure. On condi-
tion, the pilot makes a decision to identify the applicable sub-section.
Following the initial decision, a further sub-division of the procedure may
occur. In that event, one or more additional conditions guides the pilot
through the remaining decisions. Once the applicable condition(s) are
identified, the pilot follows the remaining steps until the indication "Proce-
dure Complete" is reached.
The procedure symbol levels are:

Landing Guidance
Land as Soon as Practicable

The pilot may consider the convenience of future maintenance when
selecting an airport to land as soon as practicable. Pilots must not overfly a
suitable and practicable airport for other ground conveniences.

Land as Soon as Possible

The pilot must identify and land at the first available airport that allows for
a safe approach and landing considering the approach procedures avail-
able, ceilings, visibility, winds and runway lengths

forced landings on unprepared surfaces, use full flaps if possible. Be
aware that use of full (100%) flaps will reduce glide distance. Full flaps
should not be selected until landing is assured. Land on the main gear

• WARNING •
If there is a strong smell of fuel in the cockpit, divert to the nearest suit-
able landing field. Fly a forced landing pattern and shut down the en-
gine fuel supply once a safe landing is assured.

• NOTE •
Indications of a partial power loss include fluctuating RPM,
reduced or fluctuating manifold pressure, low oil pressure, high
oil temperature, and a rough-sounding or rough-running engine.
Mild engine roughness in flight may be caused by one or more
spark plugs becoming fouled. A sudden engine roughness or
misfiring is usually evidence of a magneto malfunction.
A gradual loss of manifold pressure and eventual engine rough-
ness may result from the formation of intake ice. Opening the
alternate engine air will provide air for engine operation if the
normal source is blocked or the air filter is iced over.

• NOTE •
Low oil pressure may be indicative of an imminent engine failure.
See OIL PRESSURE Warning Checklist in this Section for special
procedures with low oil pressure.
A damaged (out-of-balance) propeller may cause extremely rough
operation. If an out-of-balance propeller is suspected, immedi-
ately shut down engine and perform Emergency Landing,
Ditching, or Emergency Landing w/o Power Checklist as appro-
priate.
If the power loss is due to a fuel leak in the injector system, fuel
sprayed over the engine may be cooled by the slipstream airflow
which may prevent a fire at altitude. However, as the Power Lever
is reduced during descent and approach to landing the cooling air
may not be sufficient to prevent an engine fire.
Selecting fuel pump ON on may clear the problem if vapor in the
injection lines is the problem or if the engine-driven fuel pump
has partially failed. The electric fuel pump will not provide suffi-
cient fuel pressure to supply the engine if the engine-driven fuel
pump completely fails.
Selecting the opposite fuel tank may resolve the problem if fuel
starvation or contamination in one tank was the problem.
Cycling the Engine Knob momentarily from BOTH to L and then
to R may help identify the problem. An obvious power loss in
single ignition operation indicates magneto or spark plug trouble.
Lean the mixture to the recommended cruise setting. If engine
does not smooth out in several minutes, try a richer mixture
setting. Return Engine Knob to the BOTH position unless extreme
roughness dictates the use of a single magneto.
If a partial engine failure permits level flight, land at a suitable
airfield as soon as conditions permit. If conditions do not permit
safe level flight, use partial power as necessary to set up a forced
landing pattern over a suitable landing field. Always be prepared
for a complete engine failure and consider CAPS deployment if a
suitable landing site is not available. Refer to Section 10, Cirrus
Airframe Parachute System (CAPS) for CAPS deployment
scenarios and landing considerations.

Inadvertent Spin Entry

1. CAPS............................................................................................. ACTIVATE

Procedure Complete

• WARNING •
In all cases, if the aircraft enters an unusual attitude following or in
connection with a stall, a spin condition should be assumed and, imme-
diate deployment of the CAPS is required. Under no circumstances
should spin recovery other than CAPS deployment be attempted.

• NOTE •
The aircraft is not approved for spins, and has not been certified
for traditional spin recovery characteristics. The only approved
and demonstrated method of spin recovery is activation of the
Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (see CAPS Deployment
Checklist, this section). Because of this, if the aircraft enters a spin,
CAPS must be deployed immediately.
While the stall characteristics of the aircraft make inadvertent
entry into a spin extremely unlikely, it is possible. Spin entry can
be avoided by using good airmanship: coordinated use of controls
in turns, proper airspeed control following the recommendations
of this manual, and never abusing the flight controls with acceler-
ated inputs when close to the stall (see Section 4, Stalls discussion).
If, at the stall, the controls are misapplied and abused aggressive
inputs are made to the elevator, rudder and/or ailerons, an abrupt
wing drop may be felt and a spin may be entered.

CIRRUS
SR20

1. CAPS ............................................................................................. ACTIVATE

Procedure Complete

• WARNING •
In all cases, if the aircraft enters an unusual attitude following or in
connection with a stall, a spin condition should be assumed and, imme-
diate deployment of the CAPS is required. Under no circumstances
should spin recovery other than CAPS deployment be attempted.

• NOTE •
The aircraft is not approved for spins, and has not been certified
for traditional spin recovery characteristics. The only approved
and demonstrated method of spin recovery is activation of the
Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (see CAPS Deployment
Checklist, this section). Because of this, if the aircraft enters a spin,
CAPS must be deployed immediately.
While the stall characteristics of the aircraft make inadvertent
entry into a spin extremely unlikely, it is possible. Spin entry can
be avoided by using good airmanship: coordinated use of controls
in turns, proper airspeed control following the recommendations
of this manual, and never abusing the flight controls with acceler-
ated inputs when close to the stall (see Section 4, Stalls discussion).
If, at the stall, the controls are misapplied and abused aggressive
inputs are made to the elevator, rudder and/or ailerons, an abrupt
wing drop may be felt and a spin may be entered.

Introduction

SECTION 3A: ABNORMAL PROCEDURES
INTRODUCTION

This section provides procedures for handling abnormal system and/or
flight conditions which, if followed, will maintain an acceptable level of
airworthiness or reduce operational risk. The guidelines described in this
section are to be used when an abnormal condition exists, and should be
considered and applied as necessary.

• WARNING •
If a Warning annunciation is illuminated in combination with any of
the following Abnormal annunciations, the Warning annunciation
takes precedence and must be performed first.

Crew Alert System (CAS) Messaging
Cautions

•

Displayed in yellow against a black background, Caution CAS messages
arise during situations that require immediate flight crew awareness and
subsequent flight crew response.
•

A flashing Caution CAS message with an accompanying aural alert
requires more timely flight crew response.
A flashing Caution CAS message with no accompanying aural alert
requires flight crew response, dependent on workload.
A non-flashing Caution CAS message with no accompanying aural
alert requires attention, dependent on workload. It may also require
performing maintenance or taking corrective action prior to next
flight.
Advisories

•

Displayed in white against a black background, Advisory CAS messages
arise during situations that require flight crew awareness and that may
require subsequent flight crew response.
Abnormal Procedures Guidance

Although this section provides procedures for handling most abnormal
system and/or flight conditions that could arise in the aircraft, it is not a
substitute for proper flight training, thorough knowledge of the airplane,
and recognized piloting techniques and standards. A thorough study of the
information in this handbook while on the ground will help you prepare for
time-critical situations in the air.

SECTION 3A: ABNORMAL PROCEDURES
INTRODUCTION

CIRRUS
SR20

Sound judgment as well as thorough knowledge of the aircraft, its charac-
teristics, and the flight manual procedures are essential in the handling of
any abnormal system and/or flight condition. In addition to the outlined
items in the Abnormal Procedures, the following steps are considered part
of all abnormal situations:
• Maintain Aircraft Control
Analyze the Situation
•
Take Appropriate Action
•

Circuit Breakers

Some procedures involve manipulating circuit breakers (CBs). The
following criteria should be followed during “Circuit Breaker” steps:
•

Intentional pulling of circuit breakers during flight, other than as
required in specific procedures, may cause abnormal or unexpected
system behavior and is not recommended.

• When instructed to “SET”, the appropriate circuit breaker should be

checked for normal condition. If the circuit breaker is not “SET”, it
may be reset only once. If the circuit breaker opens again, do not reset.

• When instructed to “PULL”, the appropriate circuit breaker should

only be pulled and not reset.

• When instructed to “CYCLE”, the appropriate circuit breaker should
be pulled, delayed for several seconds, and reset only once. Allow suffi-
cient cooling time for circuit breakers that are reset through a
“CYCLE” procedure.

Procedure Division Symbols

For procedures requiring pilot decision, conditional steps are indented
with a symbol to designate sub-sections within the procedure. On condi-
tion, the pilot makes a decision to identify the applicable sub-section.
Following the initial decision, a further sub-division of the procedure may
occur. In that event, one or more additional conditions guides the pilot
through the remaining decisions. Once the applicable condition(s) are
identified, the pilot follows the remaining steps until the indication "Proce-
dure Complete" is reached.
The procedure symbol levels are:
◆ First Level

❍ Second Level

Landing Guidance
Land as Soon as Practicable

The pilot may consider the convenience of future maintenance when
selecting an airport to land as soon as practicable. Pilots must not overfly a
suitable and practicable airport for other ground conveniences.

Land as Soon as Possible

The pilot must identify and land at the first available airport that allows for
a safe approach and landing considering the approach procedures avail-
able, ceilings, visibility, winds and runway lengths

Preflight Inspection

CIRRUS
SR20

• WARNING •
Before carrying out preflight inspections, ensure that all required main-
tenance has been accomplished. Review your flight plan and compute
weight and balance and performance requirements. Throughout the
walk-around: check all hinges, hinge pins, and bolts for security; check
skin for damage, condition, and evidence of delamination; check all con-
trol surfaces for proper movement and excessive free play; check area
around liquid reservoirs and lines for evidence of leaking.
In cold weather, remove all frost (polished or not), ice, snow, or slush
from fuselage, wing, stabilizers, and control surfaces. Ensure that con-
trol surfaces are free of internal ice or debris. Check that wheel fairings
are free of snow and ice accumulation. Check that Pitot probe warms
within 30 seconds of setting Probe Heat to ON.

Failure to comply may result in significant aircraft damage, loss
of aircraft, and/or loss of life.

Engine Start

CIRRUS
SR20

If the engine is warm, no priming is required. For the first start of the

day and in cold conditions, prime will be necessary.
Weak intermittent firing followed by puffs of black smoke from the
exhaust stack indicates over-priming or flooding. Excess fuel can be
cleared from the combustion chambers by the following procedure:

• Turn fuel pump off.
• Allow fuel to drain from intake tubes.
•

Set the mixture control to CUTOFF and the power lever to 1/2 open
position.

• Crank the engine through several revolutions with the starter.
• When the engine starts, release starter, smoothly advance the

mixture control to RICH, and promptly retard the power lever.
If the engine is under-primed, especially with a cold soaked engine, it
will not fire, and additional priming will be necessary. As soon as the
cylinders begin to fire, open the power lever slightly to keep it running.
Refer to Cold Weather Operation in this section or additional
information regarding cold weather operations.

If airplane will be started using external power, keep all personnel and
power unit cables well clear of the propeller rotation plane.

Before Taxi

CIRRUS
SR20

When taxiing, directional control is accomplished with rudder deflection
and intermittent braking (toe taps) as necessary. Proper braking practices
are critical to avoid potential damage to the brakes. Pilots unaccustomed to
free castering nose wheel steering may be inclined to “ride” the brakes to
maintain constant taxi speeds and use the brakes excessively for steering.
Use only as much power as is necessary to achieve forward movement.
Deceleration or taxi speed control using brakes but without a reduction in
power will result in increased brake temperature. Taxi over loose gravel at
low engine speed to avoid damage to the propeller tips.

SECTION 4: NORMAL PROCEDURES
NORMAL PROCEDURES

During cold weather operations, the engine should be properly warmed up
before takeoff. In most cases this is accomplished when the oil temperature
has reached at least 100 °F (38 °C). In warm or hot weather, precautions
should be taken to avoid overheating during prolonged ground engine
operation. Additionally, long periods of idling may cause fouled spark
plugs.

• WARNING •
Do not takeoff with frost, ice, snow, or other contamination on the fu-
selage, wing, stabilizers, and control surfaces.
Allow a cooling period following a high-energy braking event. High-en-

• NOTE •
Ensure mixture is appropriate for field density altitude.
Fuel flow at full throttle should be at the top of the green arc on the

Power Check: Check full-throttle engine operation early in takeoff run.
The engine should run smoothly and turn approximately 2700 RPM. Verify
all engine parameters are not in caution or warning ranges. Discontinue
takeoff at any sign of rough operation or sluggish acceleration. Make a
thorough full-throttle static run-up before attempting another takeoff.
For takeoff over a gravel surface, advance Power Lever slowly. This allows
the airplane to start rolling before high RPM is developed, and gravel will
be blown behind the propeller rather than pulled into it.
Flap Settings: All takeoffs are accomplished with flaps set at 50%.
Takeoff Techniques: Soft or rough field takeoffs are performed by lifting
the airplane off the ground as soon as practical in a tail-low attitude. If no
obstacles are ahead, the airplane should be leveled off immediately to accel-
erate to a higher climb speed.

Cruise

CIRRUS
SR20

Normal cruising is performed between 55% and 85% power. The engine
power setting and corresponding fuel consumption for various altitudes
and temperatures can be determined by using the cruise data in Section 5.
The selection of cruise altitude is made based on the most favorable wind
conditions and the desired power settings. These significant factors should
be considered on every trip to reduce fuel consumption.

• NOTE •
Avoid engine operation with low manifold pressure and high
engine RPM. Manifold pressures less than 15 in.Hg with high
engine RPM should be avoided when possible to do so. When
possible avoid rapid changes in the throttle setting. These condi-
tions can cause damage to the counterweights, rollers or bushings,
and cause detuning.
Do not do closed throttle descents which can cause ring flutter and
damage to the cylinders and piston rings.

Cruise Leaning

SECTION 4: NORMAL PROCEDURES
NORMAL PROCEDURES

• CAUTION •

If moving the mixture control from the full rich position only
decreases the EGT from the full rich value, place the mixture
control back in the full forward position and have the fuel system
serviced.
Exhaust gas temperature (EGT) may be used as an aid for mixture leaning
in cruise flight.

• NOTE •
Engine can be leaned for Best Power Cruise at any power setting.
For Best Economy use 75% power or less. For best durability, use
85% or less at best power.
To adjust the mixture, lean to establish the peak EGT as a reference point
and then adjust the mixture by the desired increment based on the
following table:

Mixture Description

Exhaust Gas Temperature

Best Power

Best Economy

100 °F Rich Of Peak EGT

Between Peak EGT and 50 °F
Lean Of Peak EGT, depending on
ambient conditions (ensuring no
misfire)

Alternatively, leaning can be done by adjusting the mixture to the cyan
Target Fuel Flow caret displayed on the fuel flow gauge.
Target Fuel Flow is determined using a calculated engine air flow based on
engine speed, manifold air temperature and manifold air pressure.
Target Fuel Flow is advisory only and does not guarantee sufficient cylinder
cooling. If any CHT's are greater than 435 °F enrich the mixture to aid in
cooling. Under some conditions, engine roughness may occur while oper-
ating at best economy. If this occurs, enrich mixture as required to smooth
engine operation. Any change in altitude or Power Lever position will
require a recheck of EGT indication.

Stalls

SECTION 4: NORMAL PROCEDURES
STALLS

Aircraft stall characteristics are conventional. Power-off stalls may be
accompanied by a slight nose bobbing if full aft stick is held. Power-on stalls
are marked by a high sink rate at full aft stick. Power-off stall speeds at
maximum weight for both forward and aft CG positions are presented in
Section 5 - Stall Speeds.
When practicing stalls at altitude, as the airspeed is slowly reduced, you will
notice a slight airframe buffet, hear the stall warning horn sound, and the
“stall, stall, stall” aural alert between 5 and 10 knots before the stall, feel a
stick shaker vibration in the side stick, and see the Crew Alerting System
display a STALL Warning annunciation. Normally, the stall is marked by a
gentle nose drop and the wings can easily be held level or in the bank with
coordinated use of the ailerons and rudder. Upon stall warning in flight,
recovery is accomplished by immediately reducing back pressure to reduce
the angle of attack and to maintain safe airspeed, adding power as required
and rolling wings level with coordinated use of the controls.

• WARNING •
Use care to avoid uncoordinated, abrupt or abused control inputs
when close to stall.
Abrupt full range power lever movement can result in engine damage.
Idle to maximum power movements of the power lever should be made
slowly (approximately 3 seconds for full range motion). Abrupt full
range power lever movements can also accentuate overly rich mixture
settings resulting in poor throttle response.

• NOTE •
If Stall Warning is inoperative, Autopilot Underspeed Protection
will not be provided in Altitude Critical Modes (ALT, GS, GP, TO
and GA), and Low Speed ESP will not be available.

Cold Weather Operation

CIRRUS

• CAUTION •
An engine that has been superficially warmed, may start and
appear to run satisfactorily, but can be damaged from lack of
lubrication due to the congealed oil blocking proper oil flow
through the engine. The amount of damage will vary and may not
become evident for many hours. However, the engine may be
severely damaged and may fail shortly following application of
high power. Proper procedures require thorough application of
preheat to all parts of the engine. Hot air must be applied directly
to the oil sump and external oil lines as well as the cylinders, air
intake and oil cooler. Because excessively hot air can damage
non-metallic components such as composite parts, seals, hoses,
and drive belts, do not attempt to hasten the preheat process.

Starting

When the engine has been exposed to temperatures below 10 °F (-12 °C) for
a period of two hours or more, the use of an external pre-heater and
external power is recommended. Failure to properly preheat a cold-soaked
engine may result in oil congealing within the engine, oil hoses, and oil
cooler with subsequent loss of oil flow, possible internal damage to the
engine, and subsequent engine failure.
If the engine does not start during the first few attempts, or if engine firing
diminishes in strength, the spark plugs have probably frosted over. Preheat
must be used before another start is attempted.

• NOTE •
When the oil temperature has reached 100 °F (38 °C) and oil pres-
sure does not exceed 70 psi at 2500 RPM, the engine has been
warmed sufficiently to accept full rated power.

Hot Weather Operation

CIRRUS
SR20

Avoid prolonged engine operation on the ground. Fuel Pump must be ON
for engine start and takeoff, and should be ON during climb for vapor
suppression which could occur under hot ambient conditions or after
extended idle.

Ground Operation of Air Conditioning System (Optional)

• NOTE •
To facilitate faster cabin cooling, prior to engine start leave the
cabin doors open for a short time to allow hot air to escape cabin.

1. Control Panel......... SELECT DESIRED MODE AND TEMPERATURE
2. Voltage..........................................................................................MONITOR
• NOTE •
Decrease electrical load if battery discharge is noted.
3. Annunciator Lights ...........................................................................CHECK

a) Verify ALTERNATOR 1 CURRENT caution light out and positive

amps indication.

4. Engine Parameters ............................................................................CHECK
Extended Ground Operation

For airplanes that experience prolonged engine operation on the ground,
the following procedure is recommended to reduce potential for spark plug
lead fouling and lead build-up on engine valve guides.
1. Set throttle to 1200 RPM.
2. Lean the mixture for maximum RPM.
3. Reduce throttle to RPM for continued ground operations (800 - 1000

RPM is recommended).

• WARNING •
 Fuel flow at full throttle should be at the top of the green arc on the
fuel flow gauge.

• NOTE •
If further ground operations will be required after the Before
Takeoff Checklist is completed, lean the mixture again (as
described above) until ready for the Takeoff Checklist.

Noise Abatement

SECTION 4: NORMAL PROCEDURES
NOISE ABATEMENT

The following suggested procedures minimize environmental noise when
operating the aircraft.

• NOTE •
Do not follow these noise abatement procedures where they
conflict with Air Traffic Control clearances or instructions,
weather considerations, or wherever they would reduce safety.
1. When operating VFR over noise-sensitive areas, such as outdoor events,
parks, and recreational areas, fly not less than 2000 feet above the
surface even though flight at a lower level may be allowed.

2. For departure from or approach to an airport, avoid prolonged flight at

low altitude near noise-sensitive areas.

Introduction

SECTION 5: PERFORMANCE DATA
INTRODUCTION

Performance data in this section are presented for operational planning so
that you will know what performance to expect from the airplane under
various ambient and field conditions. Performance data are presented for
takeoff, climb, and cruise (including range & endurance).
All data based on published normal procedures.

Standard Charts
Associated Conditions Affecting Performance

Computed performance data in this section are based upon data derived
from actual flight testing with the airplane and engine in good condition
and using average piloting techniques. Unless specifically noted in the
“Conditions” notes presented with each table, ambient conditions are for a
standard day. Flap position as well as thrust setting technique is similarly
noted with each table.
The charts in this section provide data over temperature ranges as specified
on the chart. If ambient temperature is below the chart value, use the lowest
temperature shown to compute performance. This will result in more
conservative performance calculations. If ambient temperature is above the
chart value, use caution as performance degrades rapidly at higher
temperatures.
Serials w/ optional Air Conditioning System: Brake Horsepower is reduced
by approximately 6 BHP.

Introduction

SECTION 6: WEIGHT AND BALANCE
INTRODUCTION

This section describes the procedure for calculating the weight and
moment for various operations. A comprehensive list of all equipment
available for this airplane is included at the back of this section.
It should be noted that specific information regarding the weight, arm,
moment, and installed equipment for this airplane as delivered from the
factory can be found at the back of this section.
It is the responsibility of the pilot to ensure that the airplane is loaded prop-
erly and that all changes to the basic empty weight and center of gravity are
recorded.

WEIGHT AND BALANCE RECORD

Loading Instructions

CIRRUS
SR20

It is the responsibility of the pilot to ensure that the airplane is properly
loaded and operated within the prescribed weight and center of gravity
limits. The following information enables the pilot to calculate the total
weight and moment for the loading. The calculated moment is then
compared to the Moment Limits chart or table (Figure 6-4) for a determi-
nation of proper loading.
Airplane loading determinations are calculated using the Weight & Balance
Loading Form (Figure 6-2), the Loading Data chart and table (Figure 6-3),
and the Moment Limits chart and table (Figure 6-4).

1. Basic Empty Weight – Enter the current Basic Empty Weight and

Moment from the Weight & Balance Record (Figure 6-5).

2. Front Seat Occupants – Enter the total weight and moment/1000 for the

front seat occupants from the Loading Data (Figure 6-3).

3. Rear Seat Occupants – Enter the total weight and moment/1000 for the

rear seat occupants from the Loading Data (Figure 6-3).

4. Baggage – Enter weight and moment for the baggage from the Loading

Data (Figure 6-3).

• NOTE •
If desired, subtotal the weights and moment/1000 from steps 1
through 4. This is the Zero Fuel Condition. It includes all useful
load items excluding fuel.
5. Fuel Loading – Enter the weight and moment of usable fuel loaded on

the airplane from the Loading Data (Figure 6-3).

• NOTE •
Subtotal the weight and moment/1000. This is the Ramp Condi-
tion or the weight and moment of the aircraft before taxi.
6. Fuel for start, taxi, and run-up – This value is pre-entered on the form.

Normally, fuel used for start, taxi, and run-up is approximately 9
pounds at an average moment/1000 of 1.394.

Airworthiness Directives

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) publishes Airworthiness
Directives (ADs) that apply to specific aircraft and aircraft appliances or
accessories. ADs are mandatory changes and must be complied with within
a time limit set forth in the AD. Operators should periodically check with
Cirrus Service Centers or A&P mechanic to verify receipt of the latest
issued AD for their airplane.

Airplane Inspection Periods
• NOTE •
14 CFR 1.1 defines time in service, with respect to maintenance
time records, as “the time from the moment an aircraft leaves the
surface of the earth until it touches it at the next point of landing.”
The Flight hours meter is displayed on the Status & Info synoptic
page and should be used for tracking maintenance time intervals.
The inspection items specified in the Annual/100 Inspection have
been determined by the average aircraft use rate of the typical
owner. Non-commercially operated aircraft that are flown signifi-
cantly more than 100 hours per year should consider additional
inspections commensurate with the hours flown. 100-Hour
Inspection or enrollment in a Progressive Inspection Program
should be considered in addition to the normally required Annual
Inspection. The Annual Inspection interval may also be shortened
to accommodate high utilization rate.

Annual Inspection

Unless enrolled in a Progressive Inspection Program, The U.S. Federal
Aviation Regulations require all civil aircraft must undergo a thorough
Annual Inspection every twelve calendar months. Annual Inspections are
due on the last day of the twelfth month following the last Annual Inspec-
tion. For example: If an Annual Inspection was performed on 19 November
2015, the next Annual Inspection will be due 30 November 2016. Annual
Inspections must be accomplished regardless of the number of hours flown

the previous year and can only be performed by a licensed Airframe and
Powerplant (A&P) mechanic holding an Inspection Authorization (IA).
Annual inspections can only be performed by facilities approved by Cirrus.
The inspection is listed, in detail, in Chapter 5 of the Airplane Maintenance
Manual.

100-Hour Inspection

If the airplane is used to carry persons or provide flight instruction for hire,
the Federal Aviation Regulations require that the airplane undergo a
100-Hour Inspection every 100 hours of flight operation in addition to the
Annual Inspection requirement. The scope of the 100-Hour Inspection is
identical to the Annual Inspection, except that it can be accomplished by a
licensed A&P mechanic. The 100-hour interval may be exceeded by not
more than 10 flight hours in order to reach a place where the inspection can
be accomplished. Any flight hours used to reach an inspection station must
be deducted from the next 100-Hour Inspection interval. The inspection is
listed, in detail, in Chapter 5 of the Airplane Maintenance Manual.

Cirrus Progressive Inspection Program

In lieu of the above requirements, an airplane may be inspected using a
Progressive Inspection Program in accordance with the Federal Aviation
Regulation Part 91.409(d).
The Cirrus Progressive Inspection Program provides for the complete
inspection of the airplane utilizing a five-phase cyclic inspection program.
400 flight hours: A total of eight inspections are accomplished over the
course of 400 flight hours, with an inspection occurring every 50 flight
hours.
800 flight hours: A total of sixteen inspections are accomplished over the
course of 800 flight hours, with an inspection occurring every 50 flight
hours.
The inspection items to be covered in the Progressive Inspection are very
similar to the Annual Inspection items. The Progressive Inspection will
accomplish a full Inspection of the airplane at 400 (or 800) flight hours or
at 12 calendar months.
The inspections are listed, in detail, in Chapter 5 of the Airplane Mainte-
nance Manual.

Application of External Power

An external power receptacle, located just aft of the cowl on the left side of
the airplane, permits the use of an external power unit for cold weather
starting and maintenance procedures.

• WARNING •
If external power will be used to start engine, keep yourself, others,
and power unit cables well clear of the propeller rotation plane.

To Apply External Power to Airplane
• CAUTION •
In accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendation, external
power should not be used to start the airplane with a dead battery
or to charge a dead or weak battery in the airplane. The battery
must be removed from the airplane and battery maintenance
performed in accordance with the appropriate AMM procedures.

1. Ensure external power unit is regulated to 28 VDC.
2. Verify BAT power switches are set to OFF.
3. Plug external power unit into the receptacle.
4.

Set BAT 1 switch to ON. 28 VDC from the external power unit will
energize the main distribution and essential distribution buses. The
airplane may now be started or electrical equipment operated.

• CAUTION •
If maintenance on avionics systems is to be performed, it is
recommended that external power be used.

To Remove External Power from Airplane

If battery power is no longer required, set BAT 1 switch ‘off.’

Servicing
Landing Gear Servicing

CIRRUS
SR20

The main landing gear wheel assemblies use 15 x 6.00 x 6 tubeless tires. The
nose wheel assembly uses a 5.00 x 5 tubeless tire.
Always keep tires inflated to the rated pressure to obtain optimum perfor-
mance and maximum service. The landing gear struts do not require
servicing. With the exception of replenishing brake fluid, wheel and brake
servicing must be accomplished in accordance with AMM procedures.

Brake Servicing
To Replenish Brake Fluid

The brake system is filled with MIL-PRF-87257 hydraulic brake fluid. The
fluid level should be checked at every oil change and at the
annual/100-hour inspection, replenishing the system when necessary. The
brake reservoir is located on the right side of the battery support frame.

• NOTE •
If the entire system must be refilled, refer to AMM Chapter 12:
Servicing, Brake Fluid Replenishing.

Install chocks.

1.
2. Release parking brake.
3. Remove top engine cowling to gain access to hydraulic fluid reservoir.
4. Clean reservoir cap and area around cap before opening reservoir cap.
5. Remove cap and add MIL-PRF-87257 hydraulic fluid as necessary to

6.

fill reservoir.
Install cap, inspect area for leaks, and then install and secure engine
cowling.

Brake Maintenance

The brake assemblies and linings should be checked at every oil change (50
hours) for general condition, evidence of overheating, and deterioration.
The aircraft should not be operated with overheated, damaged, or leaking
brakes. Conditions include, but are not limited to:
•

Tire Inflation

SECTION 8: HANDLING AND SERVICING
SERVICING

For maximum service from the tires, keep them inflated to the proper pres-
sure. When checking tire pressure, examine the tires for wear, cuts, nicks,
bruises and excessive wear.

To Inflate Tires

1. Open access doors on wheel pants to gain access to valve stems. It may
be necessary to move airplane to get valve stem aligned with the access
hole.

2. Remove valve stem cap and verify tire pressure with a dial-type tire

pressure gauge.

• CAUTION •
The LH and RH main wheel tire pressures must be within 20 psi
of each other to ensure the load is evenly distributed between the
main wheels.

3.

Inflate nose tire to 30 - 35 psi (207 - 241 kPa) and main wheel tires to
60 - 65 psi (414 - 448 kPa).

4. Replace valve stem cap and close access doors.

Propeller Servicing

The spinner and backing plate should be cleaned and inspected for cracks
frequently. Before each flight, the propeller should be inspected for nicks,
scratches, and corrosion. If found, they should be repaired as soon as
possible by a rated mechanic, since a nick or scratch causes an area of
increased stress which can lead to serious cracks or the loss of a propeller
tip. The back face of the blades should be painted when necessary with flat
black paint to retard glare. To prevent corrosion, the surface should be
cleaned and waxed periodically.

Refer to the shot peening requirement described in Section 2: Limitations,
"Propeller".

Engine Oil Servicing

The total oil capacity of the Lycoming Engines IO-390-C3B6 engine is 8
quarts (7.6 liters). The engine oil sump has a capacity of 7 quarts, and the
oil filter accounts for an additional 1 quart of the total capacity.
After the first 25 hours of operation, or four months, whichever occurs first,
it is required that the oil be changed, the oil filter replaced, and the oil pres-
sure screen be cleaned and inspected, in accordance with the manufac-
turer’s instructions for continued airworthiness.

It is recommended that the oil be changed every 50 hours, or every four
months, whichever occurs first, and sooner under unfavorable operating
conditions.
Refer to Section 2, Powerplant Limitations, for approved oil grades.
An oil filler cap and dipstick are located at the right rear of the engine and
are accessible through an access door on the top right side of the engine
cowling.

• CAUTION •
The engine must not be operated with less than six quarts of oil in
the sump (dipstick indication). Seven quarts is recommended for
extended flights.

To Check and Add Oil

1. Open access door on upper right-hand side of cowl. Pull dipstick and

2.

verify oil level.
If oil level is below 6 quarts (5.7 liters), remove filler cap and add oil
through filler as required to reach 6 - 7 quarts (5.7 - 6.6 liters).

3. Verify oil level and install dipstick and filler cap.
4. Close and secure access panel.

For Engine Break-In

Mineral oil should be used for the first 50 hours of engine operation or until
oil consumption stabilizes.
An engine break-in is done to seat the piston rings and stabilize oil
consumption.
During the break-in period, it is important to keep the engine temperatures
as cool as reasonably possible, while operating at a higher power setting.
Engine operation at power settings between 65% and 75% power are
recommended. To aid in keeping engine temperatures cool, it is recom-
mended to operate the engine at best power fuel flows or slightly richer for
the first 50 hours of engine operation, or until oil consumption stabilizes.
During break-in, make sure the engine is operated at 65% or higher cruise
power as much as practical to ensure correct piston ring seating. Cruise
power of 75% for the first hour of flight, and alternating power settings
between 65% and 75% power for the second hour of flight, is recommended
for proper engine break-in. Engine operation below 65% cruise power
during engine break-in can cause poor engine performance.
Operate the engine at cruise power at lower altitudes for engine break-in.
Density altitude in excess of 8,000 feet (2438 m) will prevent the engine
from reaching sufficient cruise power for an acceptable break-in. An alti-
tude of 5,000 feet (1524 m) is recommended.

• CAUTION •
Aviation grade 100 LL (blue) or 100 (green) fuel is the minimum
octane approved for use in this airplane.

1. Place fire extinguisher near fuel tank being filled.
2. Connect ground wire from refuel nozzle to airplane exhaust, from

airplane exhaust to fuel truck or cart, and from fuel truck or cart to a
suitable earth ground.

3. Place rubber protective cover over wing around fuel filler.

• NOTE •
Do not permit fuel nozzle to come in contact with bottom of fuel
tanks. Keep fuel tanks at least half full at all times to minimize
condensation and moisture accumulation in tanks. In extremely
humid areas, the fuel supply should be checked frequently and
drained of condensation to prevent possible distribution prob-
lems.

4. Remove fuel filler cap and fuel airplane to desired level.

• NOTE •
If fuel is going to be added to only one tank, the tank being
serviced should be filled to the same level as the opposite tank.
This will aid in keeping fuel loads balanced.
Refer to Section 2: Limitations, "Fuel" for maximum fuel imbal-
ance information.

5. Remove nozzle, install filler cap, and remove protective cover.
6. Repeat refuel procedure for opposite wing.
7. Remove ground wires.

Fuel Contamination and Sampling

Typically, fuel contamination results from foreign material such as water,
dirt, rust, and fungal or bacterial growth. Additionally, chemicals and addi-
tives that are incompatible with fuel or fuel system components are also a
source of fuel contamination. To ensure that the proper grade of fuel is used
and that contamination is not present, the fuel must be sampled prior to
each flight.
Each fuel system drain must be sampled by draining a cupful of fuel into a
clear sample cup. Fuel drains are provided for the fuel gascolator, wing
tanks, and collector tank drains. The gascolator drain exits the lower engine
cowl just forward of the firewall near the airplane centerline. Fuel tank and
collector tank drains are located at the low spot in the respective tank.
If sampling reveals contamination, the gascolator and tank drains must be
sampled again repeatedly until all contamination is removed. It is helpful
to gently rock the wings and lower the tail slightly to move contaminates to
the drain points for sampling. If after repeated samplings (three or more),
evidence of significant contamination remains, do not fly the airplane until
a mechanic is consulted, the fuel system is drained and purged, and the
source of contamination is determined and corrected.
If sampling reveals the airplane has been serviced with an improper fuel
grade, do not fly the airplane until the fuel system is drained and refueled
with an approved fuel grade.
To help reduce the occurrence of contaminated fuel coming from the
supplier or fixed based operator, pilots should ensure that the fuel supply
has been checked for contamination and that the fuel is properly filtered.
Also, between flights, the fuel tanks should be kept as full as operational
conditions permit to reduce condensation on the inside of fuel tanks. In
extremely humid areas, the fuel supply should be checked frequently and
drained of condensation to prevent possible contamination.

De-Fueling

The bulk of the fuel may be drained from the wing fuel tanks by the use of
a siphon hose placed in the cell or tank through the filler neck. The
remainder of the fuel may be drained by opening the drain valves. Use the
same precautions as when refueling airplane. Refer to the AMM for specific
procedures.

ELT Servicing

SECTION 8: HANDLING AND SERVICING
SERVICING

The ELT batteries must be inspected in accordance with the Airplane
Maintenance Manual, 5-20 - Scheduled Maintenance Checks.
The ELT batteries must be replaced upon reaching the date stamped on the
batteries, after an inadvertent activation of unknown duration, or when-
ever the batteries have been in use for one cumulative hour.

Inspection / Test

After setting transmitter switch to TEST position, the ELT automatically
enters a self-test mode. The self-test transmits a 406 MHz test coded pulse
that monitors certain system functions before shutting off. The test pulse is
ignored by any satellite that receives the signal, but the ELT uses this pulse
to check output power and frequency. Other parameters of the ELT are
checked and a set of error codes is generated if a problem is found. The
error codes are indicated by a series of pulses on the transmitter LED, the
Remote Switch and Control Panel Indicator (RCPI) LED, and alert buzzer.
• NOTE •
FAA regulations require that transmitter tests only be done
during the first 5 minutes of each hour and must not last for more
than 3 audio sweeps (1.5 seconds). If you are at a location where
there is an FAA control tower or other monitoring facility, notify
the facility before beginning the tests. Never activate the ELT
while airborne for any reason.
Operators may wish to use a low quality AM broadcast receiver to
determine if energy is being transmitted from the antenna. When
the antenna of the radio (tuning dial on any setting) is held about
6 inches from the activated ELT antenna, the ELT aural tone will
be heard on the AM broadcast receiver. This is not a measured
check, but it does provide confidence that the antenna is radiating
sufficient power to aid search and rescue. The aircraft’s VHF
receiver, tuned to 121.5 MHz, may also be used. This receiver,
however, is more sensitive and could pick up a weak signal even if
the radiating ELT’s antenna is disconnected. Therefore, it does
not check the integrity of the ELT system or provide the same level
of confidence as does an AM radio.

To Service ELT

1. Tune aircraft receiver to 121.5 MHz.
2. Push switch lever to TEST position for approximately 1 second, and

then release.

Introduction

SECTION 10: SAFETY INFORMATION
INTRODUCTION

This aircraft is designed to operate safely and efficiently in a flight environ-
ment. However, like any other aircraft, pilots must maintain proficiency to
achieve maximum safety, utility, and economy. Cirrus strongly recom-
mends that all pilots seek regular recurrent training and that they operate
in accordance with the Cirrus Flight Operations Manual and Envelope of
Safety.
As the pilot, you must be thoroughly familiar with the contents of this
Handbook, the Handbook Supplements, Flight Checklist, and operational
guides and data provided by manufacturers of equipment installed in this
airplane. You must operate the airplane in accordance with the applicable
FAA operating rules and within the limitations specified in Section 2 of this
Handbook.

• NOTE •
Refer to Section 9: Log of Supplements for applicable FAA oper-
ating rules.
The Normal Procedures section of this Handbook was designed to provide
guidance for day-to-day operation of this airplane. The procedures given
are the result of flight testing, FAA certification requirements, and input
from pilots with a variety of operational experience. Become fully familiar
with the procedures, perform all the required checks, and operate the
airplane within the limitations and as outlined in the procedures.

Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS)

The Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS) is designed to lower the
aircraft and its passengers to the ground in the event of a life-threatening
emergency. CAPS deployment will likely result in damage to, or loss of, the
airframe, and possible injury to the aircraft occupants. Its use should not be
taken lightly. Instead, possible CAPS activation scenarios should be well
thought out and mentally practiced by every Cirrus pilot. Pilots who regu-
larly conduct CAPS training and think about using CAPS will often have a
higher probability of deploying CAPS when necessary.
The following discussion is meant to guide your thinking about CAPS acti-
vation. Cirrus also recommends that pilots discuss CAPS deployment
scenarios with instructors as well as fellow pilots through forums such as
the Cirrus Owners and Pilots Association. In the event of a spin or loss of
aircraft control, immediate CAPS activation is required. (See Section 3) In
other situations, CAPS activation is at the informed discretion of the pilot
in command. The following discussion is intended to be informative, not
directive. It is the responsibility of you, the pilot, to determine when and
how the CAPS will be used. It is important to understand, however, that
numerous fatalities that have occurred in Cirrus aircraft accidents likely
could have been avoided if pilots had made the timely decision to deploy

CAPS. It is also important to note that CAPS has been activated by pilots at
speeds in excess of 180 knots on multiple occasions with successful
outcomes. While the best speed to activate CAPS is below 133 knots indi-
cated airspeed, a timely activation is most important for loss of control situ-
ations.

Deployment Scenarios

This section describes possible scenarios in which CAPS activation is
appropriate. This list is not intended to be exhaustive, but merely illustra-
tive of the type of circumstances when CAPS deployment could be the most
appropriate means of saving the aircraft occupants.

Mid-Air Collision

A mid-air collision likely will render the airplane unflyable by damaging
the control system or primary structure. If a mid-air collision occurs,
immediately evaluate if the airplane is controllable and structurally capable
of continued safe flight and landing. Unless it is apparent that structural
and control system damage has not occurred, CAPS activation is recom-
mended. If you are not sure of the condition of the aircraft following a
mid-air collision, CAPS activation is recommended.

Structural Failure

Structural failure may result from many situations, such as: encountering
severe gusts at speeds above the airplane's structural cruising speed, inad-
vertent full control movements above the airplane's maneuvering speed, or
exceeding the design load factor while maneuvering. If a structural failure
occurs, CAPS activation is recommended.

Loss of Control

Loss of control may result from many situations, such as: a control system
failure (disconnected or jammed controls); severe wake turbulence, severe
turbulence causing upset, severe airframe icing, or pilot disorientation
caused by vertigo or panic. If loss of control occurs, the CAPS should be
activated immediately.

• WARNING •
In the event of a spin, immediate CAPS activation is mandatory. Under
no circumstances should the pilot attempt recovery from a spin other
than by CAPS activation.

SECTION 10: SAFETY INFORMATION
CIRRUS AIRFRAME PARACHUTE SYSTEM (CAPS)

Landing Required in Terrain not Permitting a Safe Landing

If a forced landing on an unprepared surface is required CAPS activation is
recommended unless the pilot in command concludes there is a high like-
lihood that a safe landing can be accomplished. If a condition requiring a
forced landing occurs over rough or mountainous terrain, over water out
of gliding distance to land, over widespread ground fog or at night, CAPS
activation is strongly recommended. Numerous fatalities that have
occurred in Cirrus aircraft accidents likely could have been avoided if pilots
had made the timely decision to deploy CAPS.
While attempting to glide to an airfield to perform a power off landing, the
pilot must be continuously aware of altitude and ability to successfully
perform the landing. Pilot must make the determination by 2000' AGL if
the landing is assured or if CAPS will be required.

Pilot Incapacitation

Pilot incapacitation may be the result of anything from a pilot's medical
condition to a bird strike that injures the pilot. If incapacitation occurs and
the passengers are not trained to land the aircraft, CAPS activation by the
passengers is highly recommended. This scenario should be discussed with
passengers prior to flight and all appropriate passengers should be briefed
on CAPS operation so they could effectively deploy CAPS if required.

General Deployment Information
Deployment Speed

The maximum speed at which deployment has been demonstrated is 133
KIAS. Deployment at higher speeds could subject the parachute and
aircraft to excessive loads that could result in structural failure. Once a deci-
sion has been made to deploy the CAPS, make all reasonable efforts to slow
to the minimum possible airspeed. However, if time and altitude are crit-
ical, and/or ground impact is imminent, the CAPS should be activated
regardless of airspeed.
Deployment Altitude

The altitude loss during a particular deployment depends upon the
airplane's airspeed, altitude and attitude at deployment as well as other
environmental factors. In all cases, however, the chances of a successful
deployment increase with altitude. In the event of a spin, immediate CAPS
activation is mandatory regardless of altitude. In other situations, the pilot
in command may elect to troubleshoot a mechanical problem or attempt to
descend out of icing conditions if altitude and flight conditions permit. If
circumstances permit, it is advisable to activate the CAPS at or above 2,000
feet AGL. The minimum recommend altitude for activating CAPS is 600

feet AGL. A low altitude deployment leaves little or no time for the aircraft
to stabilize under the canopy or for the cabin to be secured and increases
the risk of injury or death. At any altitude, once the CAPS is determined to
be the only alternative available for saving the aircraft occupants, deploy
the system without delay.
Deployment Attitude

The CAPS has been tested in all flap configurations at speeds ranging from
VSO to VA. Most CAPS testing was accomplished from a level attitude.
Deployment from a spin was also tested. From these tests it was found that
as long as the parachute was introduced to the free air by the rocket, it
would successfully recover the aircraft into its level descent attitude under
parachute. However, it can be assumed that to minimize the chances of
parachute entanglement and reduce aircraft oscillations under the para-
chute, the CAPS should be activated from a wings-level, upright attitude if
at all possible.

Landing Considerations

After a CAPS deployment, the airplane will descend at less than 1700 feet
per minute with a lateral speed equal to the velocity of the surface wind. The
CAPS landing touchdown is equivalent to ground impact from a height of
approximately 10 feet. While the airframe, seats, and landing gear are
designed to accommodate the stress, occupants must be prepared for the
landing. The overriding consideration in all CAPS deployed landings is to
prepare the occupants for the touchdown in order to protect them from
injury as much as possible.

Emergency Landing Body Position

The most important consideration for a touchdown with CAPS deployed is
to protect the occupants from injury, especially back injury. Contacting the
ground with the back offset attempting to open a door or secure items
increases the likelihood of back injury. All occupants must be in the emer-
gency landing body position well before touchdown. After touchdown, all
occupants should maintain the emergency landing body position until the
airplane comes to a complete stop.
The emergency landing body position is assumed with tightened seat belt
and shoulder harness by placing both hands beside the legs, and holding the
upper torso erect and against the seat backs. The seat cushions contain an
aluminum honeycomb core designed to crush under impact to absorb
downward loads and help protect the spine from compression injury.

Door Position

SECTION 10: SAFETY INFORMATION
CIRRUS AIRFRAME PARACHUTE SYSTEM (CAPS)

For most situations, it is best to leave the doors latched and use the time
available to transmit emergency calls, shut down systems, and get into the
Emergency Landing Body Position well before impact. The discussion
below gives some specific recommendations, however, the pilot's decision
will depend upon all factors, including time to impact, altitude, terrain,
winds, condition of airplane, etc.
There is the possibility that one or both doors could jam at impact. If this
occurs, to exit the airplane, the occupants will have to force open a partially
jammed door or break through a door window using the Emergency Exit
Hammer located in the lid of the center armrest. This can significantly
delay the occupants from exiting the airplane.
If the pilot elects to touchdown with a door opened, there are several addi-
tional factors the pilot must consider: loss of door, possibility of head
injury, or injury from an object coming through the open door.
•

If a door is open prior to touchdown in a CAPS landing, the door will
most likely break away from the airplane at impact.
If the door is open and the airplane contacts the ground in a rolled
condition, an occupant could be thrown forward and strike their head
on the exposed door pillar. Contacting the ground in a rolled condition
could be caused by terrain that is not level, contacting an obstacle such
as a tree, or by transient aircraft attitude.

•

• With a door open, it is possible for an object such as a tree limb or
flying debris to come through the opening and strike an occupant.
• WARNING •
If it is decided to unlatch a door, unlatch one door only. Opening only
one door will provide for emergency egress as well as reduce risks as-
sociated with ground contact. Typically, this would be the copilot's
door as this allows the other occupants to exit first after the airplane
comes to rest.

Water Landings

The ability of the airplane to float after a water landing has not been tested
and is unknown. However, since there is the possibility that one or both
doors could jam and use of the emergency egress hammer to break out a
window could take some time, the pilot may wish to consider unlatching a
door prior to assuming the emergency landing body position in order to
provide a ready escape path should the airplane begin to sink.

Post-Impact Fire

If there is no fire prior to touchdown and the pilot is able to shut down the
engine, fuel, and electrical systems, there is less chance of a post impact fire.
If the pilot suspects a fire could result from impact, unlatching a door
immediately prior to assuming the emergency landing body position
should be considered to assure rapid egress.

Ground Gusts

If known or suspected that ground gusts are present in the landing zone,
there is a possibility that the parachute could drag the airplane after touch-
down, especially if the terrain is flat and without obstacles. In order to
ensure that the occupants can escape the airplane in the timeliest manner
after the airplane comes to rest, the pilot may elect to unlatch the copilot's
door for the CAPS landing. Occupants must be in the Emergency Landing
Body Position for touchdown. Occupants must not loosen seat belts until
the airplane comes to rest. When the airplane comes to rest, the occupants
should exit the airplane and immediately move upwind to prevent a sudden
gust from dragging the airplane in their direction.
